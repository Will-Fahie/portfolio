            I've had the priviledge to be nominated the project manager / "lead" of a project at Sherborne School known as "The Turing VR Project". The goal of the project is to create a virtual reality app where a user will be placed in Sherborne School, and be able to have a narrated experience where they will be educated about Alan Turing, his life, and his time as a student at Sherborne School. You can visit the school website to find out more <a href="https://www.sherborne.org/news/2021-03-24/Alan-Turing-Virtual-Reality">here.</a>

            <h3 style="text-align: center">Summary from the school website</h3>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">
            A 12 strong project team of computer science enthusiasts at Sherborne School have embarked on a project to produce an app that provides a Virtual Reality (VR) experience of Alan Turing's life, his possessions and his time at Sherborne School. Their task is to create software that runs on an Oculus Quest (2) VR headset, modelling the inside of the Macnaghten Library, containing shelves of items that have been used, or belonged to Alan Turing. Users will be able to hold the artefacts in their virtual hands, alongside reading and listening to information about them.

          <h3 style="text-align: center">Words from the Head of Computer Science, Dr David Wild</h3>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">
            I am enormously proud of the boys for driving this project with such enthusiasm and creativity. The team have harnessed and developed various skills from programming, graphic design and research. Hugely inspired by Turing and his enduring legacy, the progress of this group of future scientists and mathematicians has been completely undeterred by remote learning. The boys have conquered up remarkable solutions during this challenging time, emulating the resilience and determination of the great man himself.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3 style="text-align: center">Words from the Headmaster, Dr Dominic Luckett</h3>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">
            We continue to be very proud to count Alan Turing among our most distinguished alumni.  His crucial work as a code-breaker at Bletchley Park and his enormous contribution to the subsequent development of computing have become more widely recognised in recent years and we as a School are keen to do all we can to preserve and promote his legacy. This project is a fantastic example of the boy’s technological ingenuity, as well as their ability to work together across all year groups to share skills and ideas. When the product is complete the project team plan to launch the app and donate money generated through sales to one of Turing family’s charities. 
          </p>

          <h4 style="text-align: center">I hope to update this page in the future as the project progresses.</h4>
