            I've always had a deep fascination in the way the world works, and thus, physics has always been one of my biggest interests.
            <br><br>
            I'm actually surprised it took me as long as it did to create a blog like this. Come to think of it, it’s been years since I first struck the incredible world of science. I guess, I never thought it would be feasible to "make my own blog", but here we are!
            <br><br>
            I initially intended to write this blog solely on Mars. Including things like, providing shelter bases, managing colonies, producing resources, terraforming, legal and ethical challenges, and so on. The topic of Mars is such a wonderful area to learn about: ranging from its “blue” ocean-engulfed history, to its current “red” decor, to its potentially “green and blue” Earth-like future. However, I felt that although there was certainly merit in focusing on a more “niche” topic (such as Mars), I thought I'd enjoy my time blogging if it "restricted" (and could thus explore anything physics-related that I found to be fascinating).
            <br><br>
            I believe a blog, such as this, represents many skills and characteristics of the one who writes it. For one, there is the obvious technical know-how required in setting up and managing a blogging website (skills which may prove useful in many scenarios in the future). Two, it allows me to get a deeper, more contextual knowledge of the subject that I am likely to go into in the future. And three (perhaps the most obvious one), I get to do some blogging! This allows me to improve my writing and communication skills, as well as being able to share my enjoyment of physics with other people. A few example blog posts include:
            <br><br>
            • Harnessing energy from black holes<br>
            • The flight dynamics of drones<br>
            • Stephen Hawking’s life<br>
            • Do aliens exist?<br>
            • Asteroid mining<br>
            • Terraforming Mars<br>
            • The story of Chernobyl
            <br><br>
